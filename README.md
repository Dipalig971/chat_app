# Chat App

## Description

The chat application is a real-time messaging platform that allows users to communicate with each other using Firebase as the backend service. The app uses Firebase Authentication to securely manage user sign-ups and logins, Firebase Realtime Database for storing messages, and Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for sending push notifications when users receive messages. The app leverages GetX for state management, ensuring efficient and responsive navigation and data handling.

## Features

- Firebase Authentication: User sign-in and sign-up with email and password.

- Real-Time Messaging: Chat with real-time updates using Firebase Firestore.

- Push Notifications: Receive notifications for new messages via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
